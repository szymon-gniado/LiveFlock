# Live Flock (work in progreess)

Live Flock is an educational project aimed at honing our skills in web development using Next.js, implementing RESTful APIs with Spring and connecting it with relational database. In this project, we create a social media and streaming platform, similar to Twitter with streaming functionality reminiscent of Twitch.

## Project Overview

### Features

- ~~**Social Media**: Create and share your thoughts, connect with friends, and follow interesting accounts.~~ **(WiP)**
- ~~**Live Streaming**: Broadcast your content in real-time and engage with your audience.~~ **(WiP)**
- ~~**User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system.~~ **(WiP)**
- ~~**Real-time Interaction**: Interact with users through chat and comments.~~ **(WiP)**
- ~~**Customization**: Personalize your profile, follow your interests, and discover new content.~~ **(WiP)**

### Learning Objectives

- **Web Development**: Build the frontend using Next.js, a React framework, and the backend using Java and the Spring framework.
- **Containerization**: Gain hands-on experience with Docker, containerization, and orchestration to ensure smooth deployment and scaling.
- **RESTful API**: Create a robust RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend components.
- **Database Management**: Learn how to set up, configure, and manage a relational database (MariaDB or PostgreSQL).
- **React**: Learn React, a popular library for building user interfaces.
- **Spring**: Master the Spring framework, a key tool for creating Java-based web applications.
- **Next.js**: Explore Next.js, a framework for React that enables server-side rendering.
- **JavaScript**: Develop skills in JavaScript, the programming language that powers web development.
- **Java**: Gain proficiency in Java, a versatile programming language used in backend development.
- **MVC Architecture**: Develop the project with a well-structured Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for clean separation of concerns.
